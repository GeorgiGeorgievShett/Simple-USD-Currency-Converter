This is my Simple Currency Converter that I have developed by watching youtube videos to learn new methods and utilities to create my desired program.
I've learned a lot of new skills while building this. It is setup with an online API that uses USD as the base currency so it can only convert from USD to different currencies at the moment. The GUI was developed using JavaFX.
