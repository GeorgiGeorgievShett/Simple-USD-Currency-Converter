This is my Simple Currency Converter that I have developed by watching a youtube videos to learn new methods and utilities to create my desired program.
I've learned a lot of new skills while building this, the primary ones of which were the use of integrating a URL API for currency exchange to my software in order for the users to be updated every day with the currency exchange rates.
The main thing i've learned while building this is how to integrate a httpserverlet utility to call an online api for the converter.
The serverlet is called and is then build in a response stringbuilder. then the reader reads each line until there is no contents left (!= null).
Additionally I've learned how a the Jackson library works and can be implemented in software.
I learned more about arrays and how to use them in a more sophisticated manner.
Lastly I've learned how to check for invalid inputs better.
